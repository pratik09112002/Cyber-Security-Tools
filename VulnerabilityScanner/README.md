# CVE Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview
This tool queries the NVD (National Vulnerability Database) API to find known vulnerabilities (CVEs) for a given product and optional version. 
It is designed as a learning-focused vulnerability lookup utility that shows CVE IDs, severities, CVSS scores, short descriptions, and reference links in a clean CLI output. 
The script also supports basic severity filtering and simple pagination to avoid excessive API calls.

## Features
- ## Features
- Search by product name with optional version (any software indexed in NVD, such as databases, web servers, operating systems, browsers, etc.).
- Fetches CVEs from the official NVD JSON 2.0 API.
- Supports basic pagination with a configurable maximum number of pages.
- Filters results by minimum severity (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, or show all).
- Extracts CVSS v3.1, v3.0, or v2 base severity and score when available.
- Displays a short summary and one reference URL for each CVE for quick triage.
- Handles entries without scoring and clearly marks them as “Not scored in NVD”.

## Project Structure
- `cve_scanner.py` – main script implementing the scanner logic and CLI.
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies (`requests`).
- `README.md` – documentation for this tool.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+ (recommended).
- Internet access to reach the NVD API endpoint.
- Installed dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

## Notes and Limitations
- This tool uses a simple keyword-based search and is meant for educational and demonstration purposes, not as a full enterprise-grade vulnerability management solution.
- Results depend on NVD’s data quality and may not include all CVEs for a product/version.
- Heavy or automated use should follow NVD API usage guidelines and consider using an API key and caching.
- Only use vulnerability information in environments where you have permission to test and remediate.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for an API key and local caching to reduce repeated calls.
- Export results to JSON/CSV for further analysis.
- Add command-line arguments (product, version, severity) instead of interactive prompts.
- Integrate with other tools in the Cyber Security Tools repository for combined reporting.

## Installation
Clone the main repository and move into the VulnerabilityScanner folder:

You will be prompted for:
1. **Product name** – for example: `mysql`, `apache`, `openssl`
2. **Version (optional)** – press Enter to skip, or provide a version such as `5.7.20` or `2.4.58`

Then choose a **minimum severity** from the menu:
- `1` – CRITICAL  
- `2` – HIGH  
- `3` – MEDIUM  
- `4` – LOW  
- `5` – No filter (show all)

The tool will:
- Query the NVD API for CVEs matching your product and version.
- Apply the selected minimum severity filter.
- Print for each CVE:
  - CVE ID  
  - Severity and CVSS base score (if available)  
  - A short summary (first sentence, truncated)  
  - One reference URL  

## Example
=== Advanced CVE Vulnerability Scanner (Demo) ===
Enter product name (e.g., apache, openssl, nginx): mysql
Enter version (optional, press Enter to skip): 5.7
