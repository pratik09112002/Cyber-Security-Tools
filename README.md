# Cyber-Security-Tools
This repository is a well-organized collection of practical cybersecurity tools designed to help users automate and improve essential security tasks. It features modular, easy-to-use Python scripts with clear documentation, screenshots, and usage examples, making it a valuable resource for learning and practicing core cybersecurity and programming skills.

## Tools Included
Tools	                              Folder	                                                Description
Password Strength Analyzer	    PasswordStrengthAnalyzer/	  Evaluates password strength and provides suggestions based on length and character complexity.
Port Scanner	                  PortScanner/	                Scans a target host for open TCP ports in each range to identify exposed services. 
CVE Vulnerability Scanner  	    VulnerabilityScanner/	        Queries the NVD API to list known CVEs, severities, scores, and summaries for any product/version.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Python scripting for security automation (input handling, error handling, modular design).
- Network fundamentals: TCP ports, basic reconnaissance, and service exposure.
- Working with public security data sources and APIs (NVD CVE JSON 2.0).
- Use of multi-threading for faster scanning and better performance.
- Clean project structure, documentation, and Git/GitHub workflow for real-world collaboration.

## Outcomes: 
•	Built a command-line utility that evaluates how strong a user’s credentials are and provides clear, actionable improvement tips, helping reduce weak-password risk in lab and real-world scenarios.
•	Implemented a network-reconnaissance script that scans a target system for accessible services, identifies open TCP ports, and demonstrates how attackers discover potential entry points and how defenders can verify exposure.
•	Developed a vulnerability lookup tool that connects to a public vulnerability database, searches for known issues in any specified software and version, and summarizes each finding with severity, score, and reference links to support patching and risk assessment.

## These outcomes show you can:
•	Automate security checks with Python.
•	Work with networks and basic reconnaissance.
•	Integrate external security data (CVE/NVD) into workflows.
